If the Raspberry Pi ever loses power, the program on it will need to be restarted. Note, all of the data previously gathered is preserved on the Pi.

First, connect the Pi to a mouse, keyboard, and monitor.

Once done, make an account with PiConnect from here: https://connect.raspberrypi.com/devices.

Then instructions to link the Pi to your PiConnect account can be found here: https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/services/connect.html#link-connect. Read from "Link a Raspberry Pi device with a Connect account".

Now, to restart the program, connect the Pi to the battery pack and connect to the Pi on your device via PiConnect.

Navigate to the top left corner and click on the file explorer. You should now see a file called "esptopi.py". Right click on this and open it up with IDLE. At the top of this IDE there should be a button to run the program.

The program will now run until it loses power again.
